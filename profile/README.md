# CECAM-LTS-MAP Workshop

## Introduction
The **CECAM-LTS-MAP** (Centre Européen de Calcul Atomique et Moléculaire - Long
Time Simulations: Multi-scale Activated Processes) workshop is a premier
academic event dedicated to the exploration and dissemination of research in the
field of long-time, multi-scale simulations. This workshop focuses on the
evolution of nanoscale and multiscale systems, such as heterogeneous catalysis,
surface phenomena, and metallic alloys, through the lens of kinetic Monte Carlo
(kMC) simulations and related methodologies.

## Objectives
The workshop aims to foster an environment of academic exchange and development,
facilitating discussions on theoretical advancements, computational techniques,
and practical applications within the realm of long-time simulations. It serves
as a confluence for researchers, academicians, and practitioners to share their
insights, findings, and innovations.

### Key Topics
- **Kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) Simulations**: Delving into the intricacies of kMC
  methodologies, including variations and applications in studying system
  evolutions over mesoscopic timescales.
- **Transition State Theory (TST)**: Exploration of TST in the context of
  identifying and analyzing transition rates among configurations on potential
  energy surfaces (PES).
- **Potential Energy Surface (PES) Analysis**: Techniques and tools for mapping
  and understanding the landscape of PES, crucial for predicting system behavior
  and reactions.
## Workshop Repositories

Each key component of the workshop is associated with its own repository within
this organization. These repositories serve as a resource for participants and
the wider community, offering access to materials, discussions, and developments
from the workshop.

- **Tutorial Repositories**: Contains materials and resources for the tutorial
  sessions. These sessions introduce participants to the fundamental concepts
  and advanced methodologies in kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations,
  Transition State Theory (TST), and potential energy surface (PES) analysis.
- **Hands-on Practice Repositories**: Offer interactive modules and exercises.
  Here, participants can find the tools and data sets used during the workshop,
  enabling them to apply theoretical knowledge in practical simulation
  scenarios.
- **Poster Sessions Repository**: A collection of the posters presented during
  the workshop. This repository provides a platform for continued discussion and
  feedback on the research showcased in the poster sessions.
- **Presentations Repository**: Hosts slides, talks, and video recordings of the
  presentations given at the workshop. This repository is an invaluable resource
  for reviewing the cutting-edge research and theoretical advancements discussed
  during the event.
